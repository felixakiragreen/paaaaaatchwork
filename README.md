#  README

An experiment to learn & develop animation skill using MatchedGeometryEffect
Emphasis on a ZUI, with minimal context switching

## DONE
- [x] stub out placeholder interface sections
- [x] add a basic matched geometric effect when clicking on a room
- [x] collapse the "header" bar when "zooming" in
- [x] ensure correct aspect ratio on rooms
- [x] make the whole page scrollable
- [x] put the big boi at the top
- [x] make the rest a lazy grid
- [x] match geometry into the big boi
- [x] animate the rest into & out of the lazy grid
- [x] make every room clickable 

## TODO
- [ ] add hover state to room (join room button?)
- [ ] make the bottom rooms collapse when hopping into a room
- [ ] pop in new char over top of right side bar
- [ ] pop in new room elements (make them green) (delayed transition)

### ADVANCED
- [ ] when you scroll, collapse the header?
- [ ] clicking on a whole different space (in left nav bar) moves the entire screen up or down, based on its position in the sidebar

### PONDERING
- button to add more rooms?
- sub/room modules ...
  - can you navigate into them?
  - do they have to be a fixed aspect ratio?
