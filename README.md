#  README

An experiment to learn & develop animation skill using MatchedGeometryEffect
Emphasis on a ZUI - with minimal context switching

## DONE
+ stub out placeholder interface sections
+ add a basic matched geometric effect when clicking on a room
+ collapse the "header" bar when "zooming" in

## TODO
- add hover state to room (join room button?)
- make the bottom rooms collapse when hopping into a room
- pop in new char over top of right side bar
- pop in new room elements (make them green) (delayed transition)
- make the whole page scrollable

- put the big boi at the top
- make the rest a lazy grid
- match geometry into the big boi
- animate the rest into & out of the lazy grid
- ensure correct aspect ratio on rooms
- make every room clickable (button to add more rooms?)

- sub/room modules ...
? can you navigate into them?
? do they have to be a fixed aspect ratio?

--

clicking on a whole different space moves the entire screen up or down, based on its position in the sidebar
